# Privacy and permissions

What each plugin reads, saves and sends. Everything stays on your machine except where a section says otherwise.

## branch-guard

It reads the text of the Bash command Claude is about to run, runs `git` commands to measure it, and shows the result in a band. It saves nothing and sends nothing out. State lives in the session only and is cleared on reload.

## chatgpt

- **Sent:** the prompt, and any files you attach, go to chatgpt.com through the tab of your logged-in browser (terminal-browser). The plugin never sees your ChatGPT credentials; it drives the page you are already signed in to.
- **Saved:** answers are written to `$TMPDIR/chatgpt/` (`/tmp/chatgpt/` when `TMPDIR` is unset). Generated images are written there too, with a JPEG preview. The first line of an answer file is the chat URL.
- **Read:** `TMPDIR`, and the files you pass as attachments.
- **Kept in memory:** the list of background jobs, until a reload.

## codex-computer-use

- **Read:** the newest `~/.codex/plugins/cache/openai-bundled/unified-computer-use/<version>/.mcp.json`, to start the computer-use server. Environment values are never printed.
- **Saved by the helper** (`~/.claude/mcp/codex-cu/state/`): `approvals.json`, the apps you answered "always" for, and `helper.log`, which records the bundle id and your choice for each approval.
- **Saved by Codex:** answering "always" makes Codex save the app in its own `ComputerUseAppApprovals.json`. `/codex-cu forget` removes the app from both files; the plugin only ever removes from Codex's file.
- **Not stored:** what you see in the apps. The helper passes screen content between Claude and the computer-use server and keeps none of it.
- The helper listens on a Unix socket under `~/.claude/mcp/codex-cu/run/`, readable by your user only. Auto-approve is off by default.

## tailscale

- **Read:** `TS_API_KEY`, on every call. It is never taken from tool input.
- **Sent:** requests to the Tailscale API only.
- **Filtered:** read responses drop `machineKey`, `nodeKey`, `tailnetLockKey`, `secret`, `s3SecretAccessKey` and `token`, and any field whose name ends in `Key`, `Secret` or `Token`. Write responses are not filtered, because a new key's secret comes back once.
